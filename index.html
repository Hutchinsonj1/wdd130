        <p>My name is Jaden Hutchinson, I am getting my degree in Software Development from Brigham Young University-Idaho. I have a passion for learning - really anything that I believe will be of future benefit to me or my family. I am single. I went to Utah Valley University for over 6 years before transferring to BYU-Idaho. I have taught myself programming since the Spring of 2021. I am happy to help a few classmates if they need help.</p>
